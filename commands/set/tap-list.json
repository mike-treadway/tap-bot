During this time, an ale known as Köttbusser was outlawed because it contained oats, honey, and molasses. Over the centuries since its prohibition, Köttbusser became a lost brewing style. At Grimm Brothers, we’ve created an imperial version of this beer and named it Magic Mirror.   Magic Mirror is the antithesis ale to Snow Drop, brewed with more grains, honey and molasses and aged in oak, this beer is a malty big light colored ale.  It has just enough hops to balance the sweetness but leave a refreshing oak flavor on your tongue.",
